## What is canvacord?

Canvacord is a powerful utility to generate beautiful images in JavaScript or TypeScript. You use React-like components to declare how you want your image to look, without ever having to calculate the position of elements or worry about the size of the canvas. Canvacord does all the heavy lifting for you, such as image rendering, formats conversion, and more.

Canvacord abstracts the complexity of image generation and provides a simple and intuitive API to create images. This allows you to focus on the design and content of your images, rather than the technical details that goes into rendering them as needed.

Whether you're a beginner or an expert, Canvacord is the perfect tool to create stunning images for your projects with little to no effort.
